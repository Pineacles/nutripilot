"""SSRF guard: reject URLs whose host resolves to a non-public IP address.

Used before making any outbound HTTP request whose target is at least
partially user/agent-controlled (integration source_url, OAuth token_url),
to stop an attacker from pointing the sync worker at loopback, RFC1918,
link-local (including the 169.254.169.254 cloud metadata endpoint), CGNAT,
multicast, reserved, or unspecified addresses — IPv4 or IPv6.

Residual risk: this performs a point-in-time DNS resolution check. httpx
re-resolves the hostname itself when it actually opens the connection, so a
DNS-rebinding attacker who changes the A/AAAA record between our check and
httpx's own resolution could still reach a private address (TOCTOU). This
guard raises the bar significantly (blocks static private targets and
one-shot attacks) but is not a complete defense against an adversary who
controls DNS and can rebind mid-request.
